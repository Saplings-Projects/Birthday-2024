It's been a lovely life being a sapling, and watching you grow from debut to now, it's crazy that its only been almost 3 years! I'm happy to have been around as long as I have, and hope to continue doing so until the ends of the earth, which might be a good while, hehe. For now, enjoy this level based on a few aspects that have stuck with me.Thanks for also naming my cow plushie, Nemoo is doing well! :FaunaLoveRedYT:"
