message = "Dear Fauna, Happy Birthday! During tough times you've been a shining beacon breaking through the fog. Guiding me towards a more positive future. Thank you. I took the leap and shaved my head after suffering through hair loss. Thankfully I have a beard to offset the baldness :FaunaBaldYT:. You may already know I stopped eating red meat. Going one year strong! Aside from a few times, sorry! :FaunaCryYT: Thank you, Fauna. For being the goofy, quirky goth e-girl we all love. Cheers to another year! :FaunaCheerYT: :FaunaLoveRedYT: "
