message = "Happy Birthday Fauna! It’s been 3 years full of amazing fun times and soon, we’ll get many more. I watched your streams, gaming streams, karaoke streams, ASMR streams, and collab streams. You're one of my favorite Vtubers and oshies. I keep watching you because of how chill, comfy, and wholesome you are, and your comfy and chill streams are great! Thank you for all the memories, laughter, and joy that you bring us. We'll always support you. Let’s look forward to more comfy and chill times. :FaunaLoveRedYT:"
