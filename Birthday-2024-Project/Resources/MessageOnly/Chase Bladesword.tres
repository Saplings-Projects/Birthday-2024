message = "Happy Birthday to you Fauna, the wonderful and silly gaming Kirin :FaunaCheerYT: ! I remember when I first saw your debut, I was absolutely entranced by your soothing voice and beautiful elegance, and as I kept watching your streams and saw how smart and hilarious you were, I realized I finally had found my oshi in you! And now it's been around 3 years! Tell Kronii to slow down! :FaunaLOLYT: I truly hope you have lots of fun on this birthday and treat yourself to something nice because you deserve it and so much more! :FaunaLoveRedYT:"
