You make me laugh and smile every stream. It's thanks to you and other Saplings that I started drawing over a year ago and I'm still having a blast with it! You've even liked some of my art on Twitter which has further motivated me. I'm proud to call myself a Sapling and happy that you are my oshi! Thank you Fauna :FaunaLoveRedYT:"
